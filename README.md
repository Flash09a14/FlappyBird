# FlappyBird

To run the game on UNIX (Mac and Linux OSs), run the .sh file (make sure you have proper permissions to do so)
To run the game on Windows, run the .bat file on the folder directory


### For all you programming nerds, I KNOW that the 2 implementations of `main()` and `main_inverted()` are unnecessary since only a few paramters changed. I implemented it that way just in case I want to add more cool stuff exclusive to both gamemodes individually, which would be a clusterfuck harder to do with a single game class.

The main menu implementation is a bit messy, I'll fix that eventually

This took me a long time to make and I thank you for trying the game out :)

This program isn't technically the most optimal it can be, but literally any system should be able to run this, regardless of specs
